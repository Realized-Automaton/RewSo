// src/components/shared/Header.tsx
// This component is no longer used for primary navigation or site title,
// as that functionality has moved to Sidebar.tsx.
// It can be removed from the layout or repurposed if a top bar is needed for other features.
// For now, I'll leave it as an empty functional component to avoid breaking imports if it was referenced elsewhere,
// but it should be cleaned up (removed from layout.tsx and deleted) if truly unused.

export function Header() {
  return null; // Or an empty fragment <></>
}
